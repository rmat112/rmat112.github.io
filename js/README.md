# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
## Project Overview
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Results
#### Bar chart
Creating a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart displays the 'sample_values' as the values, the 'otu_ids' as the labels, and the 'otu_labels' as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

#### Bubble chart
Creating a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:

The 'otu_ids' as the x-axis values.
The 'sample_values' as the y-axis values.
The 'sample_values' as the marker size.
The 'otu_ids' as the marker colors.
The 'otu_labels' as the hover-text values.

#### Gauge chart
Creating a gauge chart that displays the 'weekly washing frequency' of the belly button value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

#### Customizing the Dashboard
##### 1. Three different customizations are added using HTML and bootstrap. 
- An image is added to jumbotron
- A background color is added to the webpage
- Customization is added to the <p> tag so the text below the title stands out<br/>
These three changes are highlited in the image below:<br/>

##### 2. When the dashboard is first opened in a browser
ID 940’s data is displayed in the dashboard, and the three charts are working according to their requirements.

##### 3. When a sample is selected
The dashboard displays the data in the panel and all three charts according to their requirements.<br/>
The image below shows the display when ID 1278 is selected:<br/>
